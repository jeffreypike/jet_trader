# Jet-Trader
In this project I trained deep reinforcement learning agents in a custom gym-like environment that simulates FOREX trading.  The purpose was not to create agents that make money, but rather to practice implementing the algorithms and see what the agents are able to learn in such a challenging environment.  Of course, the agents never mastered the environment to the point of being profitable, but they did learn how to lose <b>less</b> money and even approach breaking even in the long-run, which is not too shabby considering no hyperparameter tuning was done!  At the time this project was put on hold, I was in the process of implementing parallel learning (A3C) and considering migrating the backend to Pytorch.  If I were to pick it back up today, I would use Flax instead.  The notebooks consist of me testing around in an interactive environment, and would need an OANDA config file in order to run.
